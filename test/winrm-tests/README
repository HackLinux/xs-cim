This directory contains a set of Windows batch scripts that use the winrm cmdline tool that ships with Windows (2008/Vista and above) to issue WS-Man requests. The scripts test certain CIM classes and their methods via the WS-Man protocol (enumerate all classes, invoke methods on them etc). Wherever, XML input is required (passing parameters to a method to be invoked on a CIM class) they are read in from the XML file that are inluded in the sub-directories. Each batch file is self contained and runs tests that excericse certain scenarios (VM operations, disk operations etc). 

To run the tests:
1. Edit the setenv.bat file to include the xen server ip address, username and password.
2. Run setenv.bat to setup the test environment
3. Run the individual test script batch files to excercise the scenarios
